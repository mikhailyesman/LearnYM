We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher leave those kids alone
Hey teacher, leave those kids alone
All in all it's just
Another brick in the wall
All in all you're just
Another brick in the wall

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher leave the kids alone
Hey teacher leave us kids alone
All in all you're
Just another brick in the wall
All in all you're
Just another brick in the wall
