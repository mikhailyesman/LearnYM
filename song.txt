We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher leave those kids alone
Hey teacher, leave those kids alone
All in all it's just
Another brick in the wall
All in all you're just
Another brick in the wall

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher leave the kids alone
Hey teacher leave us kids alone
All in all you're
Just another brick in the wall
All in all you're
Just another brick in the wall

I don't need no arms around me
I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all
No don't think I'll need anything at all
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
All in all you were just bricks in the wall
